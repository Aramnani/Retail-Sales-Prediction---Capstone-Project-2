# Retail-Sales-Prediction---Capstone-Project-2
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied. My work includes various plots and graphs , visualizations , feature engineering , ensemble techniques , different ML algorithms with their respective parameter tuning , analysis and trends . Predictions are of 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 stores located across Germany.

The goal is to predict the Sales of a given store on a given day.

The main steps of the project are:

1. Basic EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis): I have performed basic EDA to understand the data and its characteristics. also, have used Univariate - BI variate - and Multivarite analysis to Understanding the correlation between variables and to explore distribution and intercation of variables.

2. Hypothesis Testing: I have performed hypothesis testing to test the relationship between the variables. Also have used statistical tests such as t-test, ANOVA, chi-square test. to compare the means or proportions of different groups or categories.

3. Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing: To create and select the most relevant and informative features for the model. Have used methods such as correlation analysis and VIF(Variance Inflation Factor) for feature selection.

4. ML Model Development and Evaluation: In this project Have developed and evaluated different machine learning Models. Have used both Linear and Polynomial Regression. Also have used Tree Based Algorithm.

5. Model Interpretation and Explanation : Explained the model predictions using feature importance. It helps to analysis the effect of different factors on the sales.
